 * Create an app that allows a user to search for a certain city's current weather

 * Past cities searched for will appear in a pop-up when typing

## 2. Description‚úèÔ∏è
This Weather Dashboard displays the current and future weather and conditions for a given city using two API calls. One is the geo call that gets latitude and longitude. The one call API fetches the weather conditions for a certain location, in this case calling for city and state.

 ## 4. Steps:ladder:
  To start, HTML is build with Bulma styuling to create box classes with widths to fit under the header title, WEATHER DASHBOARD. <br>
  
  ![Beginning page of Weather API dashboard](assets/dashboard-start.png)

  Then, once all the boxes and columns line up next to eachother, the JavaScript is created with variables set. <br>
  ![HTML with BULMA styling](assets/HTML-bulma.png)

  The variables then can be used to call for coordinates with the GEO weather API (first link showed). <br>
  ![JS variables](assets/JS-variables.png)

  The second call from the One Call API then generates data like weather, UVI, wind speed, temperates, etc. <br>
  ![API calls to fetch data for coordinates, then to display weather data and future forecast](assets/API-calls.png)

  Once a city name is typed in the search bar, the city name, date, weather icon, and weather data pulled from the APIs <br>
   display in the box to the right of Search City. Below the searched city then shows the next five days of forecast <br>
   for that same city. If a city is spelled wrong, or nothing is typed, the user gets an error message. <br>
   The recent cities that have been searched for will list under the text box for 'Search' to show the last five cities and their weather data.<br>
 Using console.log in the Devtools was a major part in creating this app. It's a great way to check functionality of code and if data is even <br>
 coming through, instead of just coding blindly. 
 The UV index color coordinating comes from a scale that ranges 0-10 and in rare cases reaches over 11. <Br>
  0-2 is low danger = green; 3-5 is moderate = yellow; 6-7 is high = orange; 8-10 is very high = red; higher than 10 is extreme = purple.<br>
  A simple app like this can be a big help for a traveler searching for their destined city to see how to pack and plan accordingly.
